DISCLAIMER: Nothing in this essay is &ldquo;canon.&rdquo; It was inspired by finding a
copy of &ldquo;<a href="Star%20Trek%20Technology%20-%20Leon%20Myerson.pdf"
target="_blank">Star Trek Technology</a>,&rdquo; &copy;1988 Leon Myerson, in some old
filing boxes, and updates and improves upon his thoughts and equations regarding warp
travel.
</P>
<P class="w3-justify">
Ships in Star Trek travel at apparent faster-than-light speeds by using a &ldquo;warp
drive&rdquo; to generate a &ldquo;warp field&rdquo; which bends space and subspace,
permitting the ship to exceed the speed of light and break the conventional laws of
inertia, momentum, kinetic energy, and special relativity. The speed of the ship is often
given as the &ldquo;warp factor.&rdquo; However, the warp factor does not directly
indicate the speed, but instead the energy density of the generated warp field. (Thus, a
larger ship, which will require a larger warp field, will also require more warp power and
a larger warp core than a smaller ship to reach the same warp factor.) Warp 1 is the field
density required to travel at the speed of light in spacetime (<i>c</i>); Warp 2 is twice
that field density, and so on. At warp factors less than Warp 1, often referred to as
&ldquo;impulse power,&rdquo; the ship, though traveling via the warp field effect, is
traveling slower than the speed of light.
</P>
<P class="w3-justify">
The formula relating the warp factor (W) to apparent speed is not the inadequate V =
W<sup>3</sup><i>c</i>. The United Federation of Planets' Treaty Exploration Zone mapped in
the <u>Starfleet Technical Manual</u> has a radius of 4,750 parsecs, or over 15,000 light
years, with the Klingon and Romulan empires located beyond Neutral Zones at the boundary
some 60 degrees apart. At a maximum safe cruising speed of Warp 6, or 216<i>c</i>, a
Constitution-class cruiser would require in excess of 70 years to reach the Federation
boundary from the center. Even at the speed given in Leon Myerson's document for Warp 6
(1,927<i>c</i>), it would take 8 years to reach the Neutral Zones. To get the apparent
speed in normal spacetime in terms of <i>c</i>, one must multiply W<sup>3</sup> by the
simplified Cochrane function:

The result is referred to as an apparent speed because it does not have the same
properties (momentum, inertia, or kinetic energy) as a true velocity in spacetime. In
fact, a ship which shuts down its warp engines will decelerate from whatever speed it was
traveling to a near halt relative to the local spacetime environment as the warp field
around the ship gradually collapses. Thus, we will continue to use the term
&ldquo;speed&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;velocity&rdquo; to refer to the motion of a
starship under warp power.
</p>
<P class="w3-justify">
It should be noted that the Cochrane equation &AElig;(W) above is a simplification that is
only valid in a spacetime free of extreme gravitational, electromagnetic, and other fields
and gradients, and quantum or subspace distortions. In the presence of these factors, the
Cochrane equation becomes much more complicated, leading to effects such as a ship which
accelerates suddenly to a high warp factor while extremely close to an object of stellar
mass potentially traveling backward in time (assuming it is not destroyed in the process).
</p>
<P class="w3-justify">
From the earliest days of starship operations, the speeds produced by warp fields were
found to be smaller than predicted. At first, engineers blamed inefficiencies in the
ships' reactors, warp cores, warp coils, or warp nacelles, but after further
investigation, it was found that W&sup3;&AElig;<i>c</i> only describes the apparent
spacetime motion of a theoretical dimensionless warp field in subspace. Real warp engines
and the fields they produce exist simultaneously in spacetime and subspace and have
non-zero dimensions, which produces a &ldquo;continuum drag&rdquo; effect. This drag can
be characterized as a reduction from a generated warp factor (W) to an effective warp
factor (&Wcirc;), though the actual warp field energy density is still the same:
</p>
<p>
<div class="w3-center equation">
&Wcirc; = 10<span style="font-size:smaller">&times;</span>tanh(W<span
  style="font-size:smaller">&times;</span>arccoth(10))
</div>
</p>
<P class="w3-justify">
Because the actual warp field energy density is still the same, the generated warp factor
is used in the Cochrane equation &AElig;(W) rather than the effective warp factor. This
results in:

<P class="w3-justify">
The continuum drag becomes larger and larger as more power is applied, resulting in an
absolute maximum speed of 403,429<i>c</i> at infinite generated power and an effective Warp 10.
</P>
<P class="w3-justify">
By the 24<sup>th</sup> century, it had become standard practice to give warp factors in
terms of the effective warp factor rather than the generated warp factor, which explains
the apparent discrepancy between the eras. Here is the standard warp factor scale used in
the 24<sup>th</sup> century:

When an Intrepid-class starship was trapped in the Delta Quadrant, approximately 60,000
light years from Federation space, its crew estimated that the travel time necessary to
reach Federation space would be approximately 70 years. This indicates that it could not
sustain a speed above Warp 3 over that distance, likely due to problems supplying fuel and
energy faster than it was consumed at higher speeds. For a Federation vessel to travel at
its maximum safe cruising speed of of Warp 6 over any significant distance, therefore,
likely depends on the extensive network of starbases, base stations, and friendly planets
established by the Federation within their space.
</p>
<P class="w3-justify">
Constitution-class and later vessels have Tertiary warp drives; hence their speed is
proportional to &Wcirc;<sup>3</sup>. Simpler warp drives can also be constructed which
generate speeds proportional to &Wcirc; (Primary warp) or &Wcirc;<sup>2</sup> (Secondary
warp):

Primary warp was the first type of warp propulsion system developed, and it is still in
use on later vessels as part of the &ldquo;impulse drive&rdquo; system, because it is far
more efficient at sub-light speeds:

<P class="w3-justify">
When Secondary warp drives were developed, the terminology of vessel design adopted the
convention of referring to the hull housing the Secondary drive system as the secondary
hull, and the other housing the impulse drive with its Primary drive system as the primary
hull. With the advent of Tertiary drive systems, there were still only two drive systems
and two main hull sections, so the one with the larger engine system continued to be
called the secondary hull.
</p>
<P class="w3-justify">
The impulse drive in the Primary hull, also known as the &ldquo;saucer section,&rdquo; is
usually only capable of propelling the ship at sub-light speeds. However, after a ship
separation, the saucer section alone requires a much smaller warp field to enclose it and
thus can travel at speeds faster than light, allowing it to escape to a nearby base or
planet.
</p>
<P class="w3-justify">
A fascinating side-effect of the Cochrane equation is that, theoretically, a
&ldquo;Nullary&rdquo; warp drive proportional to W<sup>0</sup> (which is equal to 1 for
all values of W) would have the following apparent speeds:
</p>
<div class="w3-responsive">
<table class="w3-table-all w3-centered">

</table>
</div>
<P class="w3-justify">
The speed of such a &ldquo;Nullary&rdquo; drive with no energy supplied would be 0.145 times the speed
of light, allowing rapid interplanetary travel at low or no energy cost. Though subspace
particles are known to obey this equation (and, in fact, cannot be observed at rest in
spacetime as a result), Federation scientists have been unable to take advantage of this
phenomenon.
</p>
<P class="w3-justify">
Another effect of this phenomenon is that the &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; of spacetime
&ldquo;carried along&rdquo; by any warp drive containing the generating ship is subject to
the relativistic effects of the &ldquo;zero-energy nullary&rdquo; speed of 0.145<i>c</i>,
though that only results in a time dilation of about 1%. Due to the complex interactions
at the boundary between the &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; of spacetime and the warp field, in any
instant of time, the ship and its occupants observe the outside universe (when observing
using conventional particles such as photons of light) as though they are traveling at
0.145<i>c</i> relative to their state before activating the warp field. However, this view
is inconsistent from one instant to the next, as the apparent positions of objects will
change at a rate consistent with the ship's actual apparent speed. A ship traveling at a
speed faster than light will also observe objects behind it appearing to move backward in
time, as the ship passes the photons emitted by the object, and will observe objects in
front off it appearing to move forward in time at an accelerated rate. For this reason,
standard ship's sensors can not only detect conventional particles, but also subspace
particles and effects which can move at speeds up to and even beyond an effective speed of
Warp 10.

Leon Myerson's equations, while an excellent effort, result in speeds that are much too
slow to explain warp travel in the Star Trek universe. As seen at right below, using his
equations, a starship would require about 8 years to reach the Neutral Zones from the
center of Federation space at a maximum safe cruising speed of Warp 6, which would make
the &ldquo;five-year mission&rdquo; impossible to complete:
